 c203 Week 03:
=======
  * `all.c` : is exactly the script in Question 1 of the workshop sheet this week, you can use that file as a single .c file, the reason I put it here is just for your convevience: if you copy from here you don't have the indentation problems as in the case of copying from the .PDF version.
  * the files: llqueue.h, llqueue.c, bst.h, bst.c, and main.c are extracted from all.c to make a multi-file C project. Again, the job of cutting all.c into these files is simple, and you might just want to do it yourself.
  * Makefile, which is the Makefile of last week `toy` software, ith an additional target `all ` for compiling all.c. If you edit it correctly you should be able to run `make bst` or just `make` to compile the bst software, and run `make all` to compile the `all.c`.
  * JOB: obviously you need to implement some functions inside bst.c. 


If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c203-master` or `c203-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c203` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c203-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c203-master.ZIP`
