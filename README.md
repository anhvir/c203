=======
  * `10_C203_18S2.pdf`: slides for this week, and:
  * heap skeleton from previous weeks

------------------------------------------------------

HOWTO download the repository to your computer:

If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c203-master` or `c203-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c203` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c203-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c203-master.ZIP`
