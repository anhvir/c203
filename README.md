 c203 Week 06:
=======
  * `07_C203_18S2.pdf`: slides for this week
  *  and some C files from last week
  *  p6.1.c - a copy of p6.1.c from LMS this week
  * `postfix.c` : a program that employs stacks to evaluate (that is, compute the value of) a `postfix expression` (also referred to as `reverse Polish notation`) such as `3 5 6 + *`   (which is equivalent to our normal expression of `3*(5+6)` )   
  * `stack.c` and `stack.h`: modules for array-based stack, you can also do the version of list-based stack, skeleton of which is in LMS this week 
  * Makefile: the Makefile for 2 main targets: bst and postfix


If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c203-master` or `c203-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c203` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c203-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c203-master.ZIP`
