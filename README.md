 c203 Week 08:
=======
  * `08_C203_18S2.pdf`: slides for this week, and:
  * `Makefile` that has 2 targets: `bu_msort` for bottom-up mergesort based on linked lists, and `td_msort` for array-based top-down mergesort. Your duty this week is to finish `bu_msort`, and only after that you should start `td_msort`. 
  * `bu_msort.c` and `.h`: for implementation of bottom-up mergesort, you need to implement two functions in this file.
  *  `linked_list.c` and `.h`: a ready-to-use implementation of linked lists, it would be useful to have a look at this file and learn some techniques from here.
  *  `queue.c` and `.h`: a ready-to-use implementation of queue. Note: yhis implementation is different from what supplied in p.7.1.c. Again, it would be useful to have a look at this file and learn some techniques from here.
  * `main.c`: driver for testing bu_msort.
  * `skeleton_ms_array.c`: skeleton of a single `.c` file for implementing array-based top-dowm mergesort. The sorting algorithm here is simple, but the `merge` part is a bit tricky. Full solution is povided at the end of this file. 
  *  p7.1.c - a copy of p7.1.c from LMS this week
  *  p7.2.c - a copy of p7.2.c from LMS this week


If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c203-master` or `c203-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c203` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c203-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c203-master.ZIP`

For a teaching week, a new content is (normally) uploaded at the very beginning of the week, and that content is removed one week later.
