# comp20003-Week 05: Sample multi-file project and Makefile


How to use:
 * Download the whole directory to JupyterHub working directory (see below)
 * Compile the package with
```bash
   cd c203
   make
```
 * Explore `main.c`, `factorial.c`, `factorial.h` and `Makefile`
   to see how to make a simple package with 2 .c files
 * Explore `Makefile.ver1` and `Makefile.ver1_explained`. These
   two files are the same, and each is equivalent to the `Makefile`
 


-------------------------------------------------------------------
## HOW_TO: download/copy the files from this github repository

If you just want a single file, say, **Makefile**:
  * Click on the link **Makefile** (at the top of this github) and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your editor's window before saving on a driver. The easiest way to copy is (a) click on `Raw` to see the plain text content, then (b) press Ctrl-A then Ctrl-C to copy the whole content.  

Or, if you want to copy the whole directory to your JupyterHub working directory: 
 * You can just use `git clone`. Run the following command in a Jupyter's Terminal window:
```bash
git clone http://github.com/anhvir/c203
```
And you will see a new folder `c203` under your current directory.
