 c203 Week 02:
=======

In addition to class exercies:
  * Download this whole **c203** directory by clicking **Clone or Download** --> **Download ZIP**, it will normally be downloaded to your **Downloads** directory
  * Copy the directory **c203** from **Downloads** to your working directory
  * Try to compile and use `make` for `helloworld.c`
  * Playing with `make` and `gdb` using `random_friend.c`: 

    * First, copy `Makefile1` to `Makefile` (using command `cp Makefile1 Makefile`, and try `make`,
    * Then, run the executable `afriend`,
    * Now, you probably saw that the program crashed. Use `gdb` to find errors and fix the program.
  * Explore `Makefile2` and `Makefile3`. They are equivalent to `Makefile1` but are in a more conventional and useful format. Next week we will see the use of `Makefile2` and `Makefile3` in a more complicated context.
