 c203 Week 03:
=======
Content for this week: a number of file for a software called `toy`:
  * `intArray.h` and `intArray.c`: functions for generating a random array and counting number of prime numbers in an array
  * `prime.h` and `prime.c`: functions for checking if a number is a prime number and ...
  * `main.c` : the main program that actually employ the fuctions defined in the above module to do some (kind of) experiment on primr numbers
  * `Makefile1`, `Makefile2`, `Makefile3`, `Makefile4` : these files are all equivalent to some extent, and is a valid candidate for the `Makefile` of this `toy` project. If you want to use, say, `Makefile4` you need to:

      cp Makefile 4 Makefile

      make
 
    and that `make` will compile the `toy` software for you.
  * Why 4 versions of `Makefile`? Just only for you to compare them and learn a bit about Makefile.   

If you just want a single file, say, `main.c`:
  * Click on `main.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `main.c`

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c203-master` or `c203-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c203` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c203-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c203-master.ZIP`
