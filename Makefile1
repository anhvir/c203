# Below: "toy" is a target 
#        target toy has 3 dependencies: intArray.c, prime.c, and main.c
#        and 1 associated command "gcc ..."
# From command prompt, if we run
#        make toy         (or "make")
#        the command "gcc ..." will be executed
# When we run "make toy" again, the command "gcc..." will be
#  	executed only if at least one of the dependencies intArray.c, prime.c, and main.c
#  	has been changed since the previous run of "make toy"
#
# NOTE: there is 1, and only 1, TAB character before each command like "gcc..."
toy: intArray.c prime.c main.c
	gcc -g -o toy main.c prime.c intArray.c


# clean is a target, too
# 	"make clean" will delete all the files produced by "gcc" above
#
clean: 
	rm -f *.o toy
